# safehouse-main-front

Main frontend for safehouse

Areas for Improvement:

1. Missing Security Headers - HTML has commented-out security headers (public/index.html:7-16)
2. CSP Configuration - Content Security Policy allows unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval for scripts
3. Local Storage Usage - Theme preferences stored in localStorage (minimal risk)
4. Development Source Maps - Enabled in production build (webpack.config.cjs:50)

1. Enable security headers by uncommenting lines 7-16 in public/index.html
2. Tighten CSP policy to remove unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval if possible
3. Disable source maps in production builds
4. Consider implementing subresource integrity for CDN assets
